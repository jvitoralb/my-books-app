# my-notes-app
A Full Stack MERN application, built with TypeScript. The challenges were, for the backend, building the API with a user authentication system using `JSON Web Tokens`, and for the frontend, implementing client-side routing with React.

## [Frontend](frontend/README.md)  
The frontend uses `React` with `Typescript` and `Chakra UI` to build the React components.    
For implementing client-side routing, we used `React Router Dom v6`; for API integration, we used `React Query` and the `Axios` library.

## [Backend](backend/README.md)  
The backend was built using `Nodejs` and `Expressjs` with `TypeScript`. All the development process was done following the `Test-Driven Development`, and for the tests we used `Jest`.
The database used was `MongoDB` along with `Prisma ORM` for data manipulation.
